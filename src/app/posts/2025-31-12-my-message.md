# Reflections of a Teacher at the End of 2025

As a teacher who had the honor of teaching programming throughout the year 2025, I am truly happy and grateful to have spent this year alongside students whose small and great successes I witnessed every single day. Their achievements give my life hope, motivation, and meaning.
I have come to believe that the best job in the world is one in which you feel a deep sense of purpose and value. It does not matter where you are in the world—whether in a prosperous country or, like me, teaching in the most remote villages of Afghanistan. When work carries meaning, hardship loses its power.

### Choosing Purpose Over Comfort

Over the past year, I learned profound lessons. For the sake of my students and the mission I consider sacred, I said “no” to two very good job opportunities. I chose instead to remain committed to the path I had begun for my students’ growth and future. This decision was not easy, but it is one I deeply take pride in.

Teaching is not merely a profession; it is a responsibility. Every sacrifice made in the present shapes lives far beyond today.

### Faith, Service, and Growth

This is the last article I am writing in 2025, and in it I want to express a belief close to my heart: God created us to do good and meaningful work. I firmly believe that whenever a person acts for the sake of almighty Allah, divine support follows. Growth, strength, and guidance appear exactly when they are needed most.

### Stepping Into a New Year

I begin the new year with hope rooted in faith and a heart **full of optimism**🌼.  
God willing, may we all be granted the opportunity to serve, to grow, and to succeed.
Because when education is driven by purpose and faith, even the smallest classroom can change the future.
