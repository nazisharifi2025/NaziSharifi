# From a Mountain Village to Becoming a Guide for Others

My story begins in a small mountain village in Afghanistan—a place where opportunities were nearly invisible, but dreams still found a way to grow. We had no modern classrooms, no electricity, and few resources, yet I carried a quiet determination: one day, I would learn enough to help others who started with the same limitations.

## A Childhood of Simplicity and Big Dreams

Even while herding sheep on steep hillsides, I imagined a future shaped not by my circumstances, but by what I was willing to work for. That belief guided every step that followed.

## The Turning Point: Kabul University

After years of studying whenever and wherever I could, I sat for the national university entrance exam. Earning a place in the Computer Science faculty at Kabul University felt like crossing a bridge I had spent my entire childhood building. It wasn’t just an opportunity—it was proof that effort can carve paths where none seem to exist.

## Facing Challenges With Purpose

University life came with its own hurdles, from adjusting to a fast-paced academic environment to catching up on skills many of my classmates already had. Instead of seeing these gaps as limitations, I treated them as challenges I could grow through. Every project, lecture, and late-night study session became a step forward, a small victory in a much larger journey.

## Graduation—A Symbol of Perseverance

I graduated with a grade C, but for me, that letter represents something far greater than an academic score. It stands for resilience, self-belief, and the ability to stay committed even when the path feels uncertain. It is a reminder that progress matters more than perfection.

## Finding Purpose After the Diploma

After graduation, the direction of my life shifted unexpectedly. Opportunities felt limited, and the future seemed unclear—until I began teaching programming. What started with one student soon grew into classes of young learners, many from backgrounds similar to mine. Their determination reminded me of my own journey and ignited a passion I didn’t know I had.

## Teaching: The Calling I Didn’t Expect

Helping students write their first lines of code, understand new concepts, and believe in their potential has become one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. Every breakthrough they have is a reminder that knowledge is not just something we gain—it’s something we share.
Today, I wake up knowing that the challenges of my past became the foundation of my purpose. I chose to rise, and now I help others rise with me. If a kid from a remote mountain village can step into the world of technology and guide others toward brighter futures, then possibilities are far wider than circumstances suggest.
And together, we’ll keep proving that—student by student, line of code by line of code.
