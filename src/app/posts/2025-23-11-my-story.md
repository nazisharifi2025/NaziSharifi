The first day I entered the world of technology, I had no big plans—just a simple curiosity to learn how to use a computer. When I stepped into programming, those basic lessons became the foundation of a world where I could create, solve, and explore in ways I had never imagined."

# Curiosity: The Beginning of a Change in Direction

Simple computer learning was no longer enough for me. I wanted to know what was happening behind the screen, how programs were built, and who wrote them. A curiosity that started small slowly became serious and pulled me toward the world of programming.
Entering this world was not easy. Everything felt new, complex, and sometimes discouraging. Code that didn’t run, errors I couldn’t understand, and moments when I thought this path might not be for me. Yet, alongside all these difficulties, there was a strange feeling—the feeling of creating and understanding.

## Programming: More Than Writing Code


Over time, I realized that programming is not just about writing a few lines of code. It changes the way you think. You learn patience, logical thinking, and not being afraid of mistakes. Every error became a new lesson, and every solved problem a step forward.
I learned that progress is not always big or sudden; sometimes it is hidden in small daily steps. Those quiet, consistent efforts are what build the foundation of the future.

## Continuing the Journey: A Path Still in Motion


Today, when I look back at the starting point, I see that everything began with a simple decision: learning how to use a computer. That simple beginning opened the door to a much larger world—the world of technology and programming. A path that is still ongoing and continues to offer something new to learn every day.
This story is not finished yet. I am still learning, still building, and still at the beginning of a journey that started with curiosity. Sometimes, a simple beginning is all it takes to shape a different future.

<!-- ## Facing Challenges With Purpose

University life came with its own hurdles, from adjusting to a fast-paced academic environment to catching up on skills many of my classmates already had. Instead of seeing these gaps as limitations, I treated them as challenges I could grow through. Every project, lecture, and late-night study session became a step forward, a small victory in a much larger journey.

## Graduation—A Symbol of Perseverance

I graduated with a grade C, but for me, that letter represents something far greater than an academic score. It stands for resilience, self-belief, and the ability to stay committed even when the path feels uncertain. It is a reminder that progress matters more than perfection.

## Finding Purpose After the Diploma

After graduation, the direction of my life shifted unexpectedly. Opportunities felt limited, and the future seemed unclear—until I began teaching programming. What started with one student soon grew into classes of young learners, many from backgrounds similar to mine. Their determination reminded me of my own journey and ignited a passion I didn’t know I had.

## Teaching: The Calling I Didn’t Expect

Helping students write their first lines of code, understand new concepts, and believe in their potential has become one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. Every breakthrough they have is a reminder that knowledge is not just something we gain—it’s something we share.
Today, I wake up knowing that the challenges of my past became the foundation of my purpose. I chose to rise, and now I help others rise with me. If a kid from a remote mountain village can step into the world of technology and guide others toward brighter futures, then possibilities are far wider than circumstances suggest.
And together, we’ll keep proving that—student by student, line of code by line of code. -->
