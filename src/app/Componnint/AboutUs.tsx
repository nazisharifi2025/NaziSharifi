          The day I first entered the world of computers, my only goal was to learn the fundamentals of this realm—without exactly knowing where I was headed or which skill I should pursue. I just knew that technology is the future, and I wanted to have a part in it.

I started with HTML, and gradually got familiar with CSS and JavaScript. I experienced a strange feeling of power and creativity. I realized that with just a few lines of code, I could build a simple page or make a button respond. That moment was my true beginning—the point where my path shifted toward web development.

Since then, I have diligently learned frameworks like React and Next.js. Every project I worked on taught me how to think better, write structured code, and take user experience seriously.

Today, I proudly consider myself a web developer—someone who not only writes code but strives to build solutions, learn, grow, and be part of the digital future.
